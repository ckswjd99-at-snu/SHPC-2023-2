# SHPC-2023-2

Homeworks and final project of **Scalable High Performance Computing (M1522.006700)** lecture, at 2023 Autumn.

Gradually increases performance of **matrix-multiplication code**, using AVX-512, OpenMP, MPI, OpenCL, and CUDA.

Every codes were tested on a server cluster provided by school, with a total of 12 nodes with four RTX TITANs each.
